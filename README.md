# ðŸš€ CMake Project with OpenCV

This repository is a **step-by-step guide** on setting up a **C++ project** using CMake.  
It also demonstrates **OpenCV integration** for simple image display.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
MyProject/ â”‚-- CMakeLists.txt # CMake build configuration â”‚-- include/ # Header files â”‚ â”‚-- helper.h â”‚ â”‚-- utils.h â”‚-- src/ # Source files â”‚ â”‚-- main.cpp â”‚ â”‚-- helper.cpp â”‚ â”‚-- utils.cpp â”‚ â”‚-- image_view.cpp # OpenCV-based program â”‚-- sample.jpg # Test image (for OpenCV) â”‚-- build/ # Created when running CMake â”‚-- README.md # This documentation

Step 1: Configure CMakeLists.txt

We create two executables:

    MyExecutable â†’ Main application
    ImageViewer â†’ OpenCV-based image viewer


Build and Run
ðŸ”¹ 1. Create a Build Directory

mkdir build
cd build

ðŸ”¹ 2. Run CMake

cmake ..
make

. Run Executables

    Run the main application:

./MyExecutable

Run the OpenCV Image Viewer:

./ImageViewer


Expected Output
Main Application

Hello from main!
Hello from helperFunction!
Hello from utilsFunction!

OpenCV Image Viewer

A window opens showing sample.jpg.# hello_cmake
